	"description": " An exploitable heap-based buffer overflow exists in Iceni Argus. When it attempts to convert a malformed PDF with an object encoded w/ multiple encoding types terminating with an LZW encoded type, an overflow may occur due to a lack of bounds checking by the LZW decoder. This can lead to code execution under the context of the account of the user running it.",
