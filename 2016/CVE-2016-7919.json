  "description": " ** DISPUTED ** Moodle 3.1.2 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via unspecified vectors, related to a \"SQL Injection\" issue affecting the Administration panel function in the installation process component.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the relevance of this report, noting that \"the person who is installing Moodle must know database access credentials and they can access the database directly; there is no need for them to create a SQL injection in one of the installation dialogue fields.\"",
