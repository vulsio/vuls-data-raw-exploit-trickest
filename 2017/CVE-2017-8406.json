	"description": " An issue was discovered on D-Link DCS-1130 devices. The device provides a crossdomain.xml file with no restrictions on who can access the webserver. This allows an hosted flash file on any domain to make calls to the device's webserver and pull any information that is stored on the device. In this case, user's credentials are stored in clear text on the device and can be pulled easily. It also seems that the device does not implement any cross-site scripting forgery protection mechanism which allows an attacker to trick a user who is logged in to the web management interface into executing a cross-site flashing attack on the user's browser and execute any action on the device provided by the web management interface which steals the credentials from tools_admin.cgi file's response and displays it inside a Textfield.",
