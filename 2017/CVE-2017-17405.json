	"description": " Ruby before 2.4.3 allows Net::FTP command injection. Net::FTP#get, getbinaryfile, gettextfile, put, putbinaryfile, and puttextfile use Kernel#open to open a local file. If the localfile argument starts with the \"|\" pipe character, the command following the pipe character is executed. The default value of localfile is File.basename(remotefile), so malicious FTP servers could cause arbitrary command execution.",
