			"message": "A server is potentially vulnerable to degradation of service if\n\n    the server is configured to use RPZ,\n    the server uses NSDNAME or NSIP policy rules, and\n    an attacker can cause the server to process a specific query\n\nSuccessful exploitation of this condition will cause named to enter a state where it continues to loop while processing the query without ever reaching an end state. While in this state, named repeatedly queries the same sets of authoritative nameservers and this behavior will usually persist indefinitely beyond the normal client query processing timeout. By triggering this condition multiple times, an attacker could cause a deliberate and substantial degradation in service.\n\nOperators of servers that meet the above conditions 1. and 2. may also accidentally encounter this defect during normal operation.  It is for this reason that the decision was made to issue this advisory despite its low CVSS score."

	"description": " If named is configured to use Response Policy Zones (RPZ) an error processing some rule types can lead to a condition where BIND will endlessly loop while handling a query. Affects BIND 9.9.10, 9.10.5, 9.11.0->9.11.1, 9.9.10-S1, 9.10.5-S1.",
