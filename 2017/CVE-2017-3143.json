			"label": "Vulnerability",
			"message": "A server that relies solely on TSIG keys with no other address-based ACL protection could be vulnerable to malicious zone content manipulation using this technique.\n\nNote that the local update policy (configured with \"update-policy local;\" in named.conf) implicitly defines a key with a known key name (local-ddns) and default algorithm and no IP-based access controls on the zone updates.  In conjunction with this failure in TSIG verification, \"update-policy local\" is potentially very dangerous."

	"description": " An attacker who is able to send and receive messages to an authoritative DNS server and who has knowledge of a valid TSIG key name for the zone and service being targeted may be able to manipulate BIND into accepting an unauthorized dynamic update.
