	"description": " AlienVault USM v5.4.2 and earlier offers authenticated users the functionality of exporting generated reports via the \"/ossim/report/wizard_email.php\" script. Besides offering an export via a local download, the script also offers the possibility to send out any report via email to a given address (either in PDF or XLS format). Since there is no anti-CSRF token protecting this functionality, it is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.",
