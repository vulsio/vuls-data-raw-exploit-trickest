      "message": "Servers utilizing both DNS64 and RPZ are potentially susceptible to encountering this condition.  When this condition occurs, it will result in either an INSIST assertion failure (and subsequent abort) or an attempt to read through a NULL pointer.  On most platforms a NULL pointer read leads to a segmentation fault (SEGFAULT), which causes the process to be terminated.\n\nOnly servers which are configured to simultaneously use both Response Policy Zones (RPZ) and DNS64 (a method for synthesizing AAAA records from A records) can be affected by this vulnerability."
