	"description": " Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) component in Oracle Java SE 7 Update 21 and earlier, 6 Update 45 and earlier, and 5.0 Update 45 and earlier, and OpenJDK 7, allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality and integrity via vectors related to JDBC.  NOTE: the previous information is from the June 2013 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims from another vendor that this issue does not properly restrict access to certain class packages in the SerialJavaObject class, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Java sandbox.",
