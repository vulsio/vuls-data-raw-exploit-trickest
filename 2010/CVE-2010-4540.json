	"description": " Stack-based buffer overflow in the load_preset_response function in plug-ins/lighting/lighting-ui.c in the \"LIGHTING EFFECTS > LIGHT\" plugin in GIMP 2.6.11 allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a long Position field in a plugin configuration file. NOTE: it may be uncommon to obtain a GIMP plugin configuration file from an untrusted source that is separate from the distribution of the plugin itself. NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.",
