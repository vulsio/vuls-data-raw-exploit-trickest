	"description": " An issue was discovered in Deskpro before 2019.8.0. The /api/tickets endpoint failed to properly validate a user's privilege, allowing an attacker to retrieve arbitrary information about all helpdesk tickets stored in database with numerous filters. This leaked sensitive information to unauthorized parties. Additionally, it leaked ticket authentication code, making it possible to make changes to a ticket.",
