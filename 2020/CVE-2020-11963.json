	"description": " ** DISPUTED ** IQrouter through 3.3.1, when unconfigured, has multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities in the web-panel because of Bash Shell Metacharacter Injection. Note: The vendor claims that this vulnerability can only occur on a brand-new network that, after initiating the forced initial configuration (which has a required step for setting a secure password on the system), makes this CVE invalid. This vulnerability is “true for any unconfigured release of OpenWRT, and true of many other new Linux distros prior to being configured for the first time”.",
