	"description": " A flaw was found in python. In algorithms with quadratic time complexity using non-binary bases, when using int(\"text\"), a system could take 50ms to parse an int string with 100,000 digits and 5s for 1,000,000 digits (float, decimal, int.from_bytes(), and int() for binary bases 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 are not affected). The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.",
