  "description": " ** DISPUTED ** Citrix Gateway 11.1, 12.0, and 12.1 allows Cache Poisoning. NOTE: Citrix disputes this as not a vulnerability. By default, Citrix ADC only caches static content served under certain URL paths for Citrix Gateway usage. No dynamic content is served under these paths, which implies that those cached pages would not change based on parameter values. All other data traffic going through Citrix Gateway are NOT cached by default.",
