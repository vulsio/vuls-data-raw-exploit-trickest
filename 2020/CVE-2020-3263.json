	"description": " A vulnerability in Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute programs on an affected end-user system. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of input that is supplied to application URLs. The attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to follow a malicious URL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the application to execute other programs that are already present on the end-user system. If malicious files are planted on the system or on an accessible network file path, the attacker could execute arbitrary code on the affected system.",
