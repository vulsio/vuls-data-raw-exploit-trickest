  "description": " The God Kings application 0.60.1 for Android exposes a broadcast receiver to other apps called com.innogames.core.frontend.notifications.receivers.LocalNotificationBroadcastReceiver. The purpose of this broadcast receiver is to show an in-game push notification to the player. However, the application does not enforce any authorization schema on the broadcast receiver, allowing any application to send fully customizable in-game push notifications.",
