  "description": " A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC S7-300 CPU family (incl. related ET200 CPUs and SIPLUS variants) (All versions), SIMATIC S7-400 CPU family (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions), SIMATIC WinAC RTX (F) 2010 (All versions), SINUMERIK 840D sl (All versions). The authentication protocol between a client and a PLC via port 102/tcp (ISO-TSAP) insufficiently protects the transmitted password. This could allow an attacker that is able to intercept the network traffic to obtain valid PLC credentials.",
