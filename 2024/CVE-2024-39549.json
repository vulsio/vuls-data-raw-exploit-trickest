	"description": " A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the routing process daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an attacker to send a malformed BGP Path attribute update which allocates memory used to log the bad path attribute. This memory is not properly freed in all circumstances, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).Consumed memory can be freed by manually restarting Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd).Memory utilization could be monitored by: user@host> show system memory or show system monitor memory statusThis issue affects:Junos OS:   *  All versions before 21.2R3-S8,   *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S8,  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S4,   *  from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S3,   *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S3,  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S1,   *  from 23.4 before 23.4R1-S2, 23.4R2,  *  from 24.2 before 24.2R2-EVO.Junos OS Evolved:  *  All versions before 21.2R3-S8-EVO,   *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S8-EVO,  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S4-EVO,   *  from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S3-EVO,   *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S3-EVO,  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S1-EVO,   *  from 23.4 before 23.4R1-S2, 23.4R2,  *  from 24.2 before 24.2R2-EVO.",
