	"description": " In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:remoteproc: mediatek: Make sure IPI buffer fits in L2TCMThe IPI buffer location is read from the firmware that we load to theSystem Companion Processor, and it's not granted that both the SRAM(L2TCM) size that is defined in the devicetree node is large enoughfor that, and while this is especially true for multi-core SCP, it'sstill useful to check on single-core variants as well.Failing to perform this check may make this driver perform R/Woperations out of the L2TCM boundary, resulting (at best) in akernel panic.To fix that, check that the IPI buffer fits, otherwise return afailure and refuse to boot the relevant SCP core (or the SCP atall, if this is single core).",
