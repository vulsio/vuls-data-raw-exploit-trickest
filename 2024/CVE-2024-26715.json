	"description": " In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:usb: dwc3: gadget: Fix NULL pointer dereference in dwc3_gadget_suspendIn current scenario if Plug-out and Plug-In performed continuouslythere could be a chance while checking for dwc->gadget_driver indwc3_gadget_suspend, a NULL pointer dereference may occur.Call Stack:\tCPU1:                           CPU2:\tgadget_unbind_driver            dwc3_suspend_common\tdwc3_gadget_stop                dwc3_gadget_suspend                                        dwc3_disconnect_gadgetCPU1 basically clears the variable and CPU2 checks the variable.Consider CPU1 is running and right before gadget_driver is clearedand in parallel CPU2 executes dwc3_gadget_suspend where it findsdwc->gadget_driver which is not NULL and resumes execution and thenCPU1 completes execution. CPU2 executes dwc3_disconnect_gadget whereit checks dwc->gadget_driver is already NULL because of which theNULL pointer deference occur.",
