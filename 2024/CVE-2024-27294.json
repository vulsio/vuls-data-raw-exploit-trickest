Prior to 1.2.7, dp-golang could install files — including the compiler binary — with the wrong ownership when Puppet was run as root and the installed package was On macOS: Go version 1.4.3 through 1.21rc3, inclusive, go1.4-bootstrap-20170518.tar.gz, or go1.4-bootstrap-20170531.tar.gz. The user and group specified in Puppet code were ignored for files within the archive. dp-puppet version 1.2.7 will recreate installations if the owner or group of any file or directory within that installation does not match the requested owner or group",
