	"description": " Nginx-UI is a web interface to manage Nginx configurations. It is vulnerable to arbitrary command execution by abusing the configuration settings. The `Home > Preference` page exposes a list of system settings such as `Run Mode`, `Jwt Secret`, `Node Secret` and `Terminal Start Command`. While the UI doesn't allow users to modify the `Terminal Start Command` setting, it is possible to do so by sending a request to the API. This issue may lead to authenticated remote code execution, privilege escalation, and information disclosure. This vulnerability has been patched in version 2.0.0.beta.9.",
