	"description": " A symbolic link manipulation vulnerability in Trellix Anti-Malware Engine prior to the January 2024 release allows an authenticated local user to potentially gain an escalation of privileges. This was achieved by adding an entry to the registry under the Trellix ENS registry folder with a symbolic link to files that the user wouldn't normally have permission to. After a scan, the Engine would follow the links and remove the files",
