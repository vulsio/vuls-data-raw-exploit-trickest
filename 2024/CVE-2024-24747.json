	"description": " MinIO is a High Performance Object Storage. When someone creates an access key, it inherits the permissions of the parent key. Not only for `s3:*` actions, but also `admin:*` actions. Which means unless somewhere above in the access-key hierarchy, the `admin` rights are denied, access keys will be able to simply override their own `s3` permissions to something more permissive. The vulnerability is fixed in RELEASE.2024-01-31T20-20-33Z.",
