	"description": " The Social Auto Poster plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘wp_name’ parameter in the 'wpw_auto_poster_map_wordpress_post_type' AJAX function in all versions up to, and including, 5.3.14 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
