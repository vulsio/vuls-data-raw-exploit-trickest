	"description": " In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:usb: core: Prevent null pointer dereference in update_port_device_stateCurrently, the function update_port_device_state gets the usb_hub fromudev->parent by calling usb_hub_to_struct_hub.However, in case the actconfig or the maxchild is 0, the usb_hub wouldbe NULL and upon further accessing to get port_dev would result in nullpointer dereference.Fix this by introducing an if check after the usb_hub is populated.",
