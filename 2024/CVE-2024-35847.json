	"description": " In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:irqchip/gic-v3-its: Prevent double free on errorThe error handling path in its_vpe_irq_domain_alloc() causes a double freewhen its_vpe_init() fails after successfully allocating at least oneinterrupt. This happens because its_vpe_irq_domain_free() frees theinterrupts along with the area bitmap and the vprop_page andits_vpe_irq_domain_alloc() subsequently frees the area bitmap and thevprop_page again.Fix this by unconditionally invoking its_vpe_irq_domain_free() whichhandles all cases correctly and by removing the bitmap/vprop_page freeingfrom its_vpe_irq_domain_alloc().[ tglx: Massaged change log ]",
