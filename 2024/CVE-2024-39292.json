	"description": " In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:um: Add winch to winch_handlers before registering winch IRQRegistering a winch IRQ is racy, an interrupt may occur before the winch isadded to the winch_handlers list.If that happens, register_winch_irq() adds to that list a winch that isscheduled to be (or has already been) freed, causing a panic later inwinch_cleanup().Avoid the race by adding the winch to the winch_handlers list beforeregistering the IRQ, and rolling back if um_request_irq() fails.",
