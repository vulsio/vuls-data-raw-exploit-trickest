	"description": " The Media Hygiene: Remove or Delete Unused Images and More! plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized loss of data due to a missing capability check on the bulk_action_delete and delete_single_image_call AJAX actions in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary attachments. A nonce check was added in version 3.0.1, however, it wasn't until version 3.0.2 that a capability check was added.",
