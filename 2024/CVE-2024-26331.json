	"description": " ReCrystallize Server 5.10.0.0 uses a authorization mechanism that relies on the value of a cookie, but it does not bind the cookie value to a session ID. Attackers can easily modify the cookie value, within a browser or by implementing client-side code outside of a browser. Attackers can bypass the authentication mechanism by modifying the cookie to contain an expected value.",
