	"description": " In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:rtnetlink: Correct nested IFLA_VF_VLAN_LIST attribute validationEach attribute inside a nested IFLA_VF_VLAN_LIST is assumed to be astruct ifla_vf_vlan_info so the size of such attribute needs to be at leastof sizeof(struct ifla_vf_vlan_info) which is 14 bytes.The current size validation in do_setvfinfo is against NLA_HDRLEN (4 bytes)which is less than sizeof(struct ifla_vf_vlan_info) so this validationis not enough and a too small attribute might be cast to astruct ifla_vf_vlan_info, this might result in an out of bandsread access when accessing the saved (casted) entry in ivvl.",
