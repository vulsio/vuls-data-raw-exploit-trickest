		}
	],
	"description": " Bludit uses the SHA-1 hashing algorithm to compute password hashes. Thus, attackers could determine cleartext passwords with brute-force attacks due to the inherent speed of SHA-1. In addition, the salt that is computed by Bludit is generated with a non-cryptographically secure function.",
