	"description": " The Colibri WP theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.94. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the colibriwp_install_plugin() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to install recommended plugins via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
