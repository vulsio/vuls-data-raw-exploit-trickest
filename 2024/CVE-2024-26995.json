	"description": " In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:usb: typec: tcpm: Correct the PDO counting in pd_setOff-by-one errors happen because nr_snk_pdo and nr_src_pdo areincorrectly added one. The index of the loop is equal to the number ofPDOs to be updated when leaving the loop and it doesn't need to be addedone.When doing the power negotiation, TCPM relies on the \"nr_snk_pdo\" asthe size of the local sink PDO array to match the Source capabilitiesof the partner port. If the off-by-one overflow occurs, a wrong RDOmight be sent and unexpected power transfer might happen such as overvoltage or over current (than expected).\"nr_src_pdo\" is used to set the Rp level when the port is in Sourcerole. It is also the array size of the local Source capabilities whenfilling up the buffer which will be sent as the Source PDOs (such asin Power Negotiation). If the off-by-one overflow occurs, a wrong Rplevel might be set and wrong Source PDOs will be sent to the partnerport. This could potentially cause over current or port resets.",
