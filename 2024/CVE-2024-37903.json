Starting in version 2.6.0 and prior to versions 4.1.18 and 4.2.10, by crafting specific activities, an attacker can extend the audience of a post they do not own to other Mastodon users on a target server, thus gaining access to the contents of a post not intended for them. Versions 4.1.18 and 4.2.10 contain a patch for this issue.",
