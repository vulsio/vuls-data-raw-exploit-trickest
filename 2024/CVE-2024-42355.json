	"description": " Shopware, an open ecommerce platform, has a new Twig Tag `sw_silent_feature_call` which silences deprecation messages while triggered in this tag. Prior to versions 6.6.5.1 and 6.5.8.13, it accepts as parameter a string the feature flag name to silence, but this parameter is not escaped properly and allows execution of code. Update to Shopware 6.6.5.1 or 6.5.8.13 to receive a patch. For older versions of 6.2, 6.3,  and 6.4, corresponding security measures are also available via a plugin.",
