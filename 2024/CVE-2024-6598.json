	"description": " A denial-of-service attack is possible through the execution functionality of KNIME Business Hub 1.10.0 and 1.10.1. It allows an authenticated attacker with job execution privileges to execute a job that causes internal messages to pile up until there are no more resources available for processing new messages. This leads to an outage of most functionality of KNIME Business Hub. Recovery from the situation is only possible by manual administrator interaction. Please contact our support for instructions in case you have run into this situation.Updating to KNIME Business Hub 1.10.2 or later solves the problem.",
