	"description": " In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:io_uring: fix possible deadlock in io_register_iowq_max_workers()The io_register_iowq_max_workers() function calls io_put_sq_data(),which acquires the sqd->lock without releasing the uring_lock.Similar to the commit 009ad9f0c6ee (\"io_uring: drop ctx->uring_lockbefore acquiring sqd->lock\"), this can lead to a potential deadlocksituation.To resolve this issue, the uring_lock is released before callingio_put_sq_data(), and then it is re-acquired after the function call.This change ensures that the locks are acquired in the correctorder, preventing the possibility of a deadlock.",
