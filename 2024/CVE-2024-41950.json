	"description": " Haystack is an end-to-end LLM framework that allows you to build applications powered by LLMs, Transformer models, vector search and more. Haystack clients that let their users create and run Pipelines from scratch are vulnerable to remote code executions. Certain Components in Haystack use Jinja2 templates, if anyone can create and render that template on the client machine they run any code. The vulnerability has been fixed with Haystack `2.3.1`.",
