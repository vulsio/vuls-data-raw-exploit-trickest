	"description": " In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:r8169: fix LED-related deadlock on module removalBinding devm_led_classdev_register() to the netdev is problematicbecause on module removal we get a RTNL-related deadlock. Fix thisby avoiding the device-managed LED functions.Note: We can safely call led_classdev_unregister() for a LED evenif registering it failed, because led_classdev_unregister() detectsthis and is a no-op in this case.",
