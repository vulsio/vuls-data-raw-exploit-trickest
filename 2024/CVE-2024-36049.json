	"description": " Aptos Wisal payroll accounting before 7.1.6 uses hardcoded credentials in the Windows client to fetch the complete list of usernames and passwords from the database server, using an unencrypted connection. This allows attackers in a machine-in-the-middle position read and write access to personally identifiable information (PII) and especially payroll data and the ability to impersonate legitimate users with respect to the audit log.",
