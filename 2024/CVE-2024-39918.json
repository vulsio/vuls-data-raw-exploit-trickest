	"description": " @jmondi/url-to-png is an open source URL to PNG utility featuring parallel rendering using Playwright for screenshots and with storage caching via Local, S3, or CouchDB. Input of the `ImageId` in the code is not sanitized and may lead to path traversal. This allows an attacker to store an image in an arbitrary location that the server has permission to access. This issue has been addressed in version 2.1.2 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
