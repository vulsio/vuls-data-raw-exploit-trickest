	"description": " In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ASoC: mediatek: sof-common: Add NULL check for normal_link stringIt's not granted that all entries of struct sof_conn_stream declarea `normal_link` (a non-SOF, direct link) string, and this is the casefor SoCs that support only SOF paths (hence do not support both directand SOF usecases).For example, in the case of MT8188 there is no normal_link string inany of the sof_conn_stream entries and there will be more driversdoing that in the future.To avoid possible NULL pointer KPs, add a NULL check for `normal_link`.",
