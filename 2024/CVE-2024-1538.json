	"description": " The File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 7.2.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wp_file_manager page that includes files through the 'lang' parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include local JavaScript files that can be leveraged to achieve RCE via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This issue was partially patched in version 7.2.4, and fully patched in 7.2.5.",
