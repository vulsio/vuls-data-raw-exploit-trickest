	"description": " In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:cachefiles: add missing lock protection when pollingAdd missing lock protection in poll routine when iterating xarray,otherwise:Even with RCU read lock held, only the slot of the radix tree isensured to be pinned there, while the data structure (e.g. structcachefiles_req) stored in the slot has no such guarantee.  The pollroutine will iterate the radix tree and dereference cachefiles_reqaccordingly.  Thus RCU read lock is not adequate in this case andspinlock is needed here.",
