	"description": " The WooCommerce - Social Login plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthenticated privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 2.7.3. This is due to a lack of brute force controls on a weak one-time password. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to brute force the one-time password for any user, except an Administrator, if they know the email of user.",
