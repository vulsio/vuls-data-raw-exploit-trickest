An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by including crafted input as the argument of an affected configuration CLI command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with the privileges of root.\r\r Note: To successfully exploit this vulnerability on a Cisco NX-OS device, an attacker must have Administrator credentials.",
