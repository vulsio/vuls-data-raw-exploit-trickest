  "description": " Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in xine-lib 1.1.12, and other versions before 1.1.15, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors related to (1) a crafted metadata atom size processed by the parse_moov_atom function in demux_qt.c and (2) frame reading in the id3v23_interp_frame function in id3.c.  NOTE: as of 20081122, it is possible that vector 1 has not been fixed in 1.1.15.",
