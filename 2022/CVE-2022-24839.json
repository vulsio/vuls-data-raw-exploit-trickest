	"description": " org.cyberneko.html is an html parser written in Java. The fork of `org.cyberneko.html` used by Nokogiri (Rubygem) raises a `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError` exception when parsing ill-formed HTML markup. Users are advised to upgrade to `>= 1.9.22.noko2`. Note: The upstream library `org.cyberneko.html` is no longer maintained. Nokogiri uses its own fork of this library located at https://github.com/sparklemotion/nekohtml and this CVE applies only to that fork. Other forks of nekohtml may have a similar vulnerability.",
