	"description": " The Ldap WP Login / Active Directory Integration WordPress plugin before 3.0.2 does not have any authorisation and CSRF checks when updating it's settings (which are hooked to the init action), allowing unauthenticated attackers to update them. Attackers could set their own LDAP server to be used to authenticated users, therefore bypassing the current authentication",
