	"description": " The Progressive License WordPress plugin through 1.1.0 is lacking any CSRF check when saving its settings, which could allow attackers to make a logged in admin change them. Furthermore, as the plugin allows arbitrary HTML to be inserted in one of the settings, this could lead to Stored XSS issue which will be triggered in the frontend as well.",
