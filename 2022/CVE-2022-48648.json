	"description": " In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:sfc: fix null pointer dereference in efx_hard_start_xmitTrying to get the channel from the tx_queue variable here is wrongbecause we can only be here if tx_queue is NULL, so we shouldn'tdereference it. As the above comment in the code says, this is veryunlikely to happen, but it's wrong anyway so let's fix it.I hit this issue because of a different bug that caused tx_queue to beNULL. If that happens, this is the error message that we get here:  BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000020  [...]  RIP: 0010:efx_hard_start_xmit+0x153/0x170 [sfc]",
