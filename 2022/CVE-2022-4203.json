	"description": " A read buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification,specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occursafter certificate chain signature verification and requires either aCA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application tocontinue certificate verification despite failure to construct a pathto a trusted issuer.The read buffer overrun might result in a crash which could lead toa denial of service attack. In theory it could also result in the disclosureof private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext)although we are not aware of any working exploit leading to memorycontents disclosure as of the time of release of this advisory.In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a maliciousserver. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requestsclient authentication and a malicious client connects.",
