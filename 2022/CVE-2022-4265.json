	"description": " The Replyable WordPress plugin before 2.2.10 does not validate the class name submitted by the request when instantiating an object in the prompt_dismiss_notice action and also lacks CSRF check in the related action. This could allow any authenticated users, such as subscriber to perform Object Injection attacks. The attack could also be done via a CSRF vector against any authenticated user",
