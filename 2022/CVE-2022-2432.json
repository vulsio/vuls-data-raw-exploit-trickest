  "description": " The Ecwid Ecommerce Shopping Cart plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 6.10.23. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ecwid_update_plugin_params function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update plugin options granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
