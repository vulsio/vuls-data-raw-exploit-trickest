	"description": " The Download Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the `file[files][]` parameter in versions up to, and including, 3.2.46 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor level permissions and above to inject arbitrary web scripts on the file's page that will execute whenever an administrator accesses the editor area for the injected file page.",
