  "description": " Improper input validation on the `contains` LoopBack filter may allow for arbitrary SQL injection. When the extended filter property `contains` is permitted to be interpreted by the Postgres connector, it is possible to inject arbitrary SQL which may affect the confidentiality and integrity of data stored on the connected database. A patch was released in version 5.5.1. This affects users who does any of the following: - Connect to the database via the DataSource with `allowExtendedProperties: true` setting OR - Uses the connector's CRUD methods directly OR - Uses the connector's other methods to interpret the LoopBack filter. Users who are unable to upgrade should do the following if applicable: - Remove `allowExtendedProperties: true` DataSource setting - Add `allowExtendedProperties: false` DataSource setting - When passing directly to the connector functions, manually sanitize the user input for the `contains` LoopBack filter beforehand.",
