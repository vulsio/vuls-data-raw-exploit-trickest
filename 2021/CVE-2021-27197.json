	"description": " DSUtility.dll in Pelco Digital Sentry Server before 7.19.67 has an arbitrary file write vulnerability. The AppendToTextFile method doesn't check if it's being called from the application or from a malicious user. The vulnerability is triggered when a remote attacker crafts an HTML page (e.g., with \"OBJECT classid=\" and \"<SCRIPT language='vbscript'>\") to overwrite arbitrary files.",
