Versions of fastify-csrf prior to 3.1.0 have a \"double submit\" mechanism using cookies with an application deployed across multiple subdomains, e.g. \"heroku\"-style platform as a service. Version 3.1.0 of the fastify-csrf fixes it. the vulnerability. The user of the module would need to supply a `userInfo` when generating the CSRF token to fully implement the protection on their end. This is needed only for applications hosted on different subdomains.",
