	"description": " In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:KVM: VMX: Don't use vcpu->run->internal.ndata as an array index__vmx_handle_exit() uses vcpu->run->internal.ndata as an index foran array access.  Since vcpu->run is (can be) mapped to a user addressspace with a writer permission, the 'ndata' could be updated by theuser process at anytime (the user process can set it to outside thebounds of the array).So, it is not safe that __vmx_handle_exit() uses the 'ndata' that way.",
