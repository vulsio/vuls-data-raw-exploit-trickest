  "description": " This affects all versions of package Flask-User. When using the make_safe_url function, it is possible to bypass URL validation and redirect a user to an arbitrary URL by providing multiple back slashes such as /////evil.com/path or \\\\\\evil.com/path. This vulnerability is only exploitable if an alternative WSGI server other than Werkzeug is used, or the default behaviour of Werkzeug is modified using 'autocorrect_location_header=False.",
