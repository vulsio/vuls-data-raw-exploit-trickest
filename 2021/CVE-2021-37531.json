	"description": " SAP NetWeaver Knowledge Management XML Forms versions - 7.10, 7.11, 7.30, 7.31, 7.40, 7.50, contains an XSLT vulnerability which allows a non-administrative authenticated attacker to craft a malicious XSL stylesheet file containing a script with OS-level commands, copy it into a location to be accessed by the system and then create a file which will trigger the XSLT engine to execute the script contained within the malicious XSL file. This can result in a full compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.",
