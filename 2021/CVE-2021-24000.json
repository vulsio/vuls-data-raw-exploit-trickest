	"description": " A race condition with requestPointerLock() and setTimeout() could have resulted in a user interacting with one tab when they believed they were on a separate tab. In conjunction with certain elements (such as &lt;input type=\"file\"&gt;) this could have led to an attack where a user was confused about the origin of the webpage and potentially disclosed information they did not intend to. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 88.",
