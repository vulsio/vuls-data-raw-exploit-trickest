  "description": " CheckMK Raw Edition software (versions 1.5.0 to 1.6.0) does not sanitise the input of a web service parameter that is in an unauthenticated zone. This Reflected XSS allows an attacker to open a backdoor on the device with HTML content and interpreted by the browser (such as JavaScript or other client-side scripts) or to steal the session cookies of a user who has previously authenticated via a man in the middle. Successful exploitation requires access to the web service resource without authentication.",
