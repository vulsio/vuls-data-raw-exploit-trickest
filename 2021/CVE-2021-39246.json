  "description": " Tor Browser through 10.5.6 and 11.x through 11.0a4 allows a correlation attack that can compromise the privacy of visits to v2 onion addresses. Exact timestamps of these onion-service visits are logged locally, and an attacker might be able to compare them to timestamp data collected by the destination server (or collected by a rogue site within the Tor network).",
