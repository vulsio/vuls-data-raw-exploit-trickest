  "description": " Data Center Expert, versions 7.5.0 and earlier, allows for the upload of a zip file from its user interface to the server. A carefully crafted, malicious file could be mistakenly uploaded by an authenticated user via this feature which could contain path traversal file names. As such, it could allow for the arbitrary upload of files contained with the zip onto the server file system outside of the intended directory. This is leveraging the more commonly known ZipSlip vulnerability within Java code.",
