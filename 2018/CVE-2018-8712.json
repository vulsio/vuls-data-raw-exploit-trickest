As a result of weak default configuration settings, limited users have full access rights to the underlying Unix system files, allowing the user to read sensitive data from the local system (using Local File Include) such as the '/etc/shadow' file via a \"GET /syslog/save_log.cgi?view=1&file=/etc/shadow\" request.",
