	"description": " An exploitable stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the retrieval of database fields in video-core's HTTP server of Samsung SmartThings Hub STH-ETH-250 devices with firmware version 0.20.17. The video-core process insecurely extracts the fields from the \"clips\" table of its SQLite database, leading to a buffer overflow on the stack. An attacker can send a series of HTTP requests to trigger this vulnerability.",
