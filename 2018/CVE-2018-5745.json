			"message": "This particular vulnerability would be very difficult for an arbitrary attacker to use because it requires an operator to have BIND configured to use a trust anchor managed by the attacker. However, if successfully exercised, the defect will cause named to deliberately exit after encountering an assertion failure.\n\nIt is more likely, perhaps, that this bug could be encountered accidentally, as not all versions of BIND support the same set of cryptographic algorithms. Specifically, recent branches of BIND have begun deliberately removing support for cryptographic algorithms that are now deprecated (for example because they are no longer considered sufficiently secure.) This vulnerability could be encountered if a resolver running a version of BIND which has removed support for deprecated algorithms is configured to use a trust anchor which elects to change algorithm types to one of those deprecated algorithms.\n\n    Support for GOST was removed from BIND in 9.13.1.\n    Support for DSA was removed from BIND in 9.13.4\n    Support for RSAMD5 will be removed from future BIND releases in the 9.13 branch and higher.\n"

	"description": " \"managed-keys\" is a feature which allows a BIND resolver to automatically maintain the keys used by trust anchors which operators configure for use in DNSSEC validation. Due to an error in the managed-keys feature it is possible for a BIND server which uses managed-keys to exit due to an assertion failure if, during key rollover, a trust anchor's keys are replaced with keys which use an unsupported algorithm. Versions affected: BIND 9.9.0 -> 9.10.8-P1, 9.11.0 -> 9.11.5-P1, 9.12.0 -> 9.12.3-P1, and versions 9.9.3-S1 -> 9.11.5-S3 of BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition. Versions 9.13.0 -> 9.13.6 of the 9.13 development branch are also affected. Versions prior to BIND 9.9.0 have not been evaluated for vulnerability to CVE-2018-5745.",
