  "description": " tlslite-ng version 0.7.3 and earlier, since commit d7b288316bca7bcdd082e6ccff5491e241305233 contains a CWE-354: Improper Validation of Integrity Check Value vulnerability in TLS implementation, tlslite/utils/constanttime.py: ct_check_cbc_mac_and_pad(); line \"end_pos = data_len - 1 - mac.digest_size\" that can result in an attacker manipulating the TLS ciphertext which will not be detected by receiving tlslite-ng. This attack appears to be exploitable via man in the middle on a network connection. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed after commit 3674815d1b0f7484454995e2737a352e0a6a93d8.",
