  "description": " An issue was discovered on Moxa AWK-3121 1.14 devices. The device provides a Wi-Fi connection that is open and does not use any encryption mechanism by default. An administrator who uses the open wireless connection to set up the device can allow an attacker to sniff the traffic passing between the user's computer and the device. This can allow an attacker to steal the credentials passing over the HTTP connection as well as TELNET traffic. Also an attacker can MITM the response and infect a user's computer very easily as well.",
