The video-core process incorrectly extracts fields from a user-controlled JSON payload, leading to a buffer overflow on the stack. The strncpy call overflows the destination buffer, which has a size of 52 bytes. An attacker can send an arbitrarily long \"callbackUrl\" value in order to exploit this vulnerability.",
