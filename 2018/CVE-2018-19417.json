	"description": " An issue was discovered in the MQTT server in Contiki-NG before 4.2. The function parse_publish_vhdr() that parses MQTT PUBLISH messages with a variable length header uses memcpy to input data into a fixed size buffer. The allocated buffer can fit only MQTT_MAX_TOPIC_LENGTH (default 64) bytes, and a length check is missing. This could lead to Remote Code Execution via a stack-smashing attack (overwriting the function return address). Contiki-NG does not separate the MQTT server from other servers and the OS modules, so access to all memory regions is possible.",
