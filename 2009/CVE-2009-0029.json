	"description": " The ABI in the Linux kernel 2.6.28 and earlier on s390, powerpc, sparc64, and mips 64-bit platforms requires that a 32-bit argument in a 64-bit register was properly sign extended when sent from a user-mode application, but cannot verify this, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly gain privileges via a crafted system call.",
