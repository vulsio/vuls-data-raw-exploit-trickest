	"description": " An authentication bypass vulnerability is present in the standalone SITS:Vision 9.7.0 component of Tribal SITS in its default configuration, related to unencrypted communications sent by the client each time it is launched. This occurs because the Uniface TLS Driver is not enabled by default. This vulnerability allows attackers to gain access to credentials or execute arbitrary SQL queries on the SITS backend as long as they have access to the client executable or can intercept traffic from a user who does.",
