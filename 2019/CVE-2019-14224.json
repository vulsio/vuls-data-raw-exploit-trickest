  "description": " An issue was discovered in Alfresco Community Edition 5.2 201707. By leveraging multiple components in the Alfresco Software applications, an exploit chain was observed that allows an attacker to achieve remote code execution on the victim machine. The attacker must upload malicious Solr configuration files and then receive a JMX connection from the victim, and serve a Java object that results in deserialization and code execution.",
