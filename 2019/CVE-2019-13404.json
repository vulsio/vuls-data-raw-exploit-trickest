  "description": " ** DISPUTED ** The MSI installer for Python through 2.7.16 on Windows defaults to the C:\\Python27 directory, which makes it easier for local users to deploy Trojan horse code. (This also affects old 3.x releases before 3.5.) NOTE: the vendor's position is that it is the user's responsibility to ensure C:\\Python27 access control or choose a different directory, because backwards compatibility requires that C:\\Python27 remain the default for 2.7.x.",
