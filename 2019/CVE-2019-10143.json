  "description": " ** DISPUTED ** It was discovered freeradius up to and including version 3.0.19 does not correctly configure logrotate, allowing a local attacker who already has control of the radiusd user to escalate his privileges to root, by tricking logrotate into writing a radiusd-writable file to a directory normally inaccessible by the radiusd user. NOTE: the upstream software maintainer has stated \"there is simply no way for anyone to gain privileges through this alleged issue.\"",
