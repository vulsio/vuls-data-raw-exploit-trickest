	"description": " The Yuzo Related Posts plugin 5.12.94 for WordPress has XSS because it mistakenly expects that is_admin() verifies that the request comes from an admin user (it actually only verifies that the request is for an admin page). An unauthenticated attacker can inject a payload into the plugin settings, such as the yuzo_related_post_css_and_style setting.",
