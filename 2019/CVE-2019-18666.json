	"description": " An issue was discovered on D-Link DAP-1360 revision F devices. Remote attackers can start a telnet service without authorization via an undocumented HTTP request. Although this is the primary vulnerability, the impact depends on the firmware version. Versions 609EU through 613EUbeta were tested. Versions through 6.12b01 have weak root credentials, allowing an attacker to gain remote root access. After 6.12b01, the root credentials were changed but the telnet service can still be started without authorization.",
