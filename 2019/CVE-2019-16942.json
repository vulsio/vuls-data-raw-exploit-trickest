  "description": " A Polymorphic Typing issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind 2.0.0 through 2.9.10. When Default Typing is enabled (either globally or for a specific property) for an externally exposed JSON endpoint and the service has the commons-dbcp (1.4) jar in the classpath, and an attacker can find an RMI service endpoint to access, it is possible to make the service execute a malicious payload. This issue exists because of org.apache.commons.dbcp.datasources.SharedPoolDataSource and org.apache.commons.dbcp.datasources.PerUserPoolDataSource mishandling.",
