  "description": " An issue was discovered in Xorux Lpar2RRD 6.11 and Stor2RRD 2.61, as distributed in Xorux 2.41. They do not correctly verify the integrity of an upgrade package before processing it. As a result, official upgrade packages can be modified to inject an arbitrary Bash script that will be executed by the underlying system. It is possible to achieve this by modifying the values in the files.SUM file (which are used for integrity control) and injecting malicious code into the upgrade.sh file.",
