	"description": " An issue was discovered in singledocparser.cpp in yaml-cpp (aka LibYaml-C++) 0.6.2. Stack Exhaustion occurs in YAML::SingleDocParser, and there is a stack consumption problem caused by recursive stack frames: HandleCompactMap, HandleMap, HandleFlowSequence, HandleSequence, HandleNode. Remote attackers could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service via a cpp file.",
