	"description": " ** DISPUTED ** A memory leak in the nl80211_get_ftm_responder_stats() function in net/wireless/nl80211.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering nl80211hdr_put() failures, aka CID-1399c59fa929. NOTE: third parties dispute the relevance of this because it occurs on a code path where a successful allocation has already occurred.",
