	"description": " Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in the Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) library in the JavaScript engine in WebKit in Apple Safari 3 Beta before Update 3.0.3, and iPhone before 1.0.1, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via certain JavaScript regular expressions. NOTE: this issue was originally reported only for MobileSafari on the iPhone.  NOTE: it is not clear whether this stems from an issue in the original distribution of PCRE, which might already have a separate CVE identifier.",
