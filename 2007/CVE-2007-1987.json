	"description": " ** DISPUTED **  Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in PHPEcho CMS 2.0 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the (1) _plugin_file parameter to smarty/internals/core.load_pulgins.php or the (2) root_path parameter to index.php.  NOTE: CVE disputes (1) because the inclusion occurs within a function that is not called during a direct request. CVE disputes (2) because root_path is defined in config.php before use.",
