	"description": " ModSecurity before 2.6.6, when used with PHP, does not properly handle single quotes not at the beginning of a request parameter value in the Content-Disposition field of a request with a multipart/form-data Content-Type header, which allows remote attackers to bypass filtering rules and perform other attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2009-5031.",
