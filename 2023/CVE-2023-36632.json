	"description": " ** DISPUTED ** The legacy email.utils.parseaddr function in Python through 3.11.4 allows attackers to trigger \"RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object\" via a crafted argument. This argument is plausibly an untrusted value from an application's input data that was supposed to contain a name and an e-mail address. NOTE: email.utils.parseaddr is categorized as a Legacy API in the documentation of the Python email package. Applications should instead use the email.parser.BytesParser or email.parser.Parser class. NOTE: the vendor's perspective is that this is neither a vulnerability nor a bug. The email package is intended to have size limits and to throw an exception when limits are exceeded; they were exceeded by the example demonstration code.",
