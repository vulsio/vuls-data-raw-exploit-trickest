	"description": " An issue was discovered in Faronics Insight 10.0.19045 on Windows. The Insight Teacher Console application exposes the teacher's Console password in cleartext via an API endpoint accessible from localhost. Attackers with physical access to the Teacher Console can open a web browser, navigate to the affected endpoint and obtain the teacher's password. This enables them to log into the Teacher Console and begin trivially attacking student machines.",
