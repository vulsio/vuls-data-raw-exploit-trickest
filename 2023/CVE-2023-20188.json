	"description": " A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business 200 Series Smart Switches, Cisco Small Business 300 Series Managed Switches, and Cisco Small Business 500 Series Stackable Managed Switches could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface on an affected device.\r\r This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of an affected interface to view a page containing malicious HTML or script content. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have valid credentials to access the web-based management interface of the affected device.\r\r Cisco has not released software updates to address this vulnerability.",
