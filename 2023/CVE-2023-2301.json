  "description": " The Contact Form Builder by vcita plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.9.1. This is due to missing nonce validation on the ls_parse_vcita_callback function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings and inject malicious JavaScript via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
