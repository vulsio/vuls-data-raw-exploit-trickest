	"description": " In versions of FreeBSD 12.4-RELEASE prior to 12.4-RELEASE-p7 and FreeBSD 13.2-RELEASE prior to 13.2-RELEASE-p5 the __sflush() stdio function in libc does not correctly update FILE objects' write space members for write-buffered streams when the write(2) system call returns an error. Â Depending on the nature of an application that calls libc's stdio functions and the presence of errors returned from the write(2) system call (or an overridden stdio write routine) a heap buffer overflow may occur.  Such overflows may lead to data corruption or the execution of arbitrary code at the privilege level of the calling program.",
