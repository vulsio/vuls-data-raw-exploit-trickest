  "description": " In spring AMQP versions 1.0.0 to2.4.16 and 3.0.0 to 3.0.9 , allowed list patterns for deserializable classnames were added to Spring AMQP, allowing users to lock down deserialization ofdata in messages from untrusted sources; however by default, when no allowedlist was provided, all classes could be deserialized.Specifically, an application isvulnerable if   *  the     SimpleMessageConverter or SerializerMessageConverter is used   *  the user     does not configure allowed list patterns   *  untrusted     message originators gain permissions to write messages to the RabbitMQ     broker to send malicious content",
