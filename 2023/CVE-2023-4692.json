	"description": " An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in grub2's NTFS filesystem driver. This issue may allow an attacker to present a specially crafted NTFS filesystem image, leading to grub's heap metadata corruption. In some circumstances, the attack may also corrupt the UEFI firmware heap metadata. As a result, arbitrary code execution and secure boot protection bypass may be achieved.",
