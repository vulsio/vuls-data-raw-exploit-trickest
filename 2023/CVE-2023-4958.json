	"description": " In Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS), it was found that some security related HTTP headers were missing, allowing an attacker to exploit this with a clickjacking attack. An attacker could exploit this by convincing a valid RHACS user to visit an attacker-controlled web page, that deceptively points to valid RHACS endpoints, hijacking the user's account permissions to perform other actions.",
