  "description": " A security vulnerability has been identified in all supported versionsof OpenSSL related to the verification of X.509 certificate chainsthat include policy constraints.  Attackers may be able to exploit thisvulnerability by creating a malicious certificate chain that triggersexponential use of computational resources, leading to a denial-of-service(DoS) attack on affected systems.Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passingthe `-policy' argument to the command line utilities or by calling the`X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function.",
