  "description": " c-ares is an asynchronous resolver library. ares_inet_net_pton() is vulnerable to a buffer underflow for certain ipv6 addresses, in particular \"0::00:00:00/2\" was found to cause an issue.  C-ares only uses this function internally for configuration purposes which would require an administrator to configure such an address via ares_set_sortlist(). However, users may externally use ares_inet_net_pton() for other purposes and thus be vulnerable to more severe issues. This issue has been fixed in 1.19.1.",
