  "description": " The Online Booking & Scheduling Calendar for WordPress by vcita plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the vcita_logout_callback function in versions up to, and including, 4.2.10. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with minimal permissions, such as a subscriber, to logout a vctia connected account which would cause a denial of service on the appointment scheduler.",
