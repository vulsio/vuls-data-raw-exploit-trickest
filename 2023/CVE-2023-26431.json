  "description": " IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses did not get recognized as \"local\" by the code and a connection attempt is made. Attackers with access to user accounts could use this to bypass existing deny-list functionality and trigger requests to restricted network infrastructure to gain insight about topology and running services. We now respect possible IPV4-mapped IPv6 addresses when checking if contained in a deny-list. No publicly available exploits are known.",
