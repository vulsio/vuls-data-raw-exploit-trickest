  "description": " Issue summary: The AES-XTS cipher decryption implementation for 64 bit ARMplatform contains a bug that could cause it to read past the input buffer,leading to a crash.Impact summary: Applications that use the AES-XTS algorithm on the 64 bit ARMplatform can crash in rare circumstances. The AES-XTS algorithm is usuallyused for disk encryption.The AES-XTS cipher decryption implementation for 64 bit ARM platform will readpast the end of the ciphertext buffer if the ciphertext size is 4 mod 5 in 16byte blocks, e.g. 144 bytes or 1024 bytes. If the memory after the ciphertextbuffer is unmapped, this will trigger a crash which results in a denial ofservice.If an attacker can control the size and location of the ciphertext bufferbeing decrypted by an application using AES-XTS on 64 bit ARM, theapplication is affected. This is fairly unlikely making this issuea Low severity one.",
