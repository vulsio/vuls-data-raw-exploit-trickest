A hotfix is available from the 1E support portal that forces the 1E Client to check for a symbolic link or junction and if it finds one refuses to use that path and instead creates a path involving a random GUID.for v8.1 use hotfix Q23097for v8.4 use hotfix Q23105for v9.0 use hotfix Q23115for SaaS customers, use 1EClient v23.7 plus hotfix Q23121",
