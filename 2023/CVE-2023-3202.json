  "description": " The MStore API plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery due to missing nonce validation on the mstore_update_firebase_server_key function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the firebase server key to push notification when order status changed via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
