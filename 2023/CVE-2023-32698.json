  ],
  "description": " nFPM is an alternative to fpm. The file permissions on the checked-in files were not maintained. Hence, when nfpm packaged the files (without extra config for enforcing itâ€™s own permissions) files could go out with bad permissions (chmod 666 or 777). Anyone using nfpm for creating packages without checking/setting file permissions before packaging could result in bad permissions for files/folders.",
