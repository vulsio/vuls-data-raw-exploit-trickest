	"description": " ReVanced API proxies requests needed to feed the ReVanced Manager and website with data. Up to and including commit 71f81f7f20cd26fd707335bca9838fa3e7df20d2, ReVanced API lacks error caching causing rate limit to be triggered thus increasing server load. This causes a denial of service for all users using the API.  It is recommended to implement proper error caching.",
