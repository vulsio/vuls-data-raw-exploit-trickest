	"description": " All versions of the package node-qpdf are vulnerable to Command Injection such that the package-exported method encrypt() fails to sanitize its parameter input, which later flows into a sensitive command execution API. As a result, attackers may inject malicious commands once they can specify the input pdf file path.",
