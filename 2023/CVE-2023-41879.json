	"description": " Magento LTS is the official OpenMage LTS codebase. Guest orders may be viewed without authentication using a \"guest-view\" cookie which contains the order's \"protect_code\". This code is 6 hexadecimal characters which is arguably not enough to prevent a brute-force attack. Exposing each order would require a separate brute force attack. This issue has been patched in versions 19.5.1 and 20.1.1.",
