Prior to version 3.118.12, it correctly blocks the `file:` URL scheme, which can be used by malicious actors to gain code execution on a victims computer, however fails to check other harmful schemes such as `ftp:`, `smb:`, etc. which can also be used. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability will enable an attacker to gain code execution on a victim's computer. Version 3.118.2 contains a patch for this issue.",
