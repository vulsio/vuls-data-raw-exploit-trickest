	"description": " Applications that use a non-default option when verifying certificates may bevulnerable to an attack from a malicious CA to circumvent certain checks.Invalid certificate policies in leaf certificates are silently ignored byOpenSSL and other certificate policy checks are skipped for that certificate.A malicious CA could use this to deliberately assert invalid certificate policiesin order to circumvent policy checking on the certificate altogether.Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passingthe `-policy' argument to the command line utilities or by calling the`X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function.",
