	"description": " The image_verify function in platform/msm_shared/image_verify.c in the Little Kernel (LK) bootloader, as distributed with Qualcomm Innovation Center (QuIC) Android contributions for MSM devices and other products, does not check whether a certain digest size is consistent with the RSA_public_decrypt API specification, which makes it easier for attackers to bypass boot-image authentication requirements via trailing data.",
