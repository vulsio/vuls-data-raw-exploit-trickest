	"description": " On desktop, Ubuntu UI Toolkit's StateSaver would serialise data on tmp/ files which an attacker could use to expose potentially sensitive data. StateSaver would also open files without the O_EXCL flag. An attacker could exploit this to launch a symlink attack, though this is partially mitigated by symlink and hardlink restrictions in Ubuntu. Fixed in 1.1.1188+14.10.20140813.4-0ubuntu1.",
