  "description": " A certain Apple patch for OpenSSL in Apple OS X 10.9.2 and earlier uses a Trust Evaluation Agent (TEA) feature without terminating certain TLS/SSL handshakes as specified in the SSL_CTX_set_verify callback function's documentation, which allows remote attackers to bypass extra verification within a custom application via a crafted certificate chain that is acceptable to TEA but not acceptable to that application.",
